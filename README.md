# Someone's PC - React Front End


## Project Description

> Someone's PC is a team-building tool for competitive Pokemon players. The application provides a reference and resource that streamlines planning teams & strategies outside of in-game play. The end user has the ability to create instances of Pokemon, organize them into game-legal teams, and adjust the stats, abilities*, and held items* of each Pokemon. 

> This project is a full stack MERN application. The API and database integration code can be found [here](https://github.com/mgballou/api-someonespc).

> I personally rebuilt & expanded this project from the original. The original Someone's PC was a group project developed with Anthony Blalock & Ciaran Kearney. Special thanks to them for all of their collaboration and contributions! The original Someone's PC can be found [here](#https://github.com/mgballou/someones-pc).
